# Search Email Application

This is a search engine that provides us with the data from ZincSearch.

## Notes:

```
Create the ENV variables in the backend to get the data from the dataset you need.

Remember to install the modules first.

To run the server go to the back-end directory and run the main program. To run the search engine, go to the front-end directory and run "npm run serve", and you will be good to GO! :)
